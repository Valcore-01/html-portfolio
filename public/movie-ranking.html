<h1>The Best Movies According to Valeria</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 of All Time:</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Wild Robot</h3>
<p>I like it because it has beautiful effects and it is funny but at the same time gets to you on a nostalgic level (also made me cry).</p>

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>I am a Marvel fan, since I was a kid, and that movie was the end of an era, the perfect ending to a series of stories that joined me throughout the years of watching movies made from Stan lee's comics.</p>

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>This one because its a classic and I cant think of another one rn (Im a TV show person)</p>
